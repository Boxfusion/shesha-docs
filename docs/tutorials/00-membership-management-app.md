# Membership Management App

For this introduction we will be building a membership management app which is designed for organisations that want to manage memberships such as political parties and schools. The tutorial is designed to teach you the basics of how building a Shesha based application works. Each step is designed to introduce you to some of the key concepts within Shesha.

NB: You will need to make sure that you have completed the [Quickstart Guide](https://shesha-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/00-quickstart/) guide on how to get setup.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Configure user roles
- Configure menus
- Configure, create and edit custom forms
- Creating and managing reference lists
- Adding a model class and database migrations
- Creating a API service
- Calling the API service from Postman
- Capturing data using our form from the admin portal
- Capturing data from a custom form the public portal

At the end of this tutorial you will have a membership management app this will allow you to capture new membership details using your designed forms and saving them in your database.

## Getting Started

Run the "SheshaMMSampleAdminPortal" app that you set up in the [Quickstart Guide](https://shesha-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/00-quickstart/) and then login. It shoulld be completely blank i.e. no menus or data in the content window.
