## Getting Started

In this tutorial we will introduce you to Shesha React JS and how to get it set up.

Once selected you will be presented with numerous ways to clone the repo, most notably HTTPS, SSH and GitHub CLI. 

The easiest method is to select 'Open with GitHub Desktop' which will launch the following screen.

This screen allows you to save it to the directory of your choice, just confirm it and no other settings need to be changed.

If you do not already have GitHub Desktop you can download it from [Github's Official Website](https://desktop.github.com/)

Once it is downloaded we can proceed to opening the folder in your choice of IDE.
