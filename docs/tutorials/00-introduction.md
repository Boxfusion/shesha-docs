# Introduction

For this introduction we will be building a membership management app which is designed for organisations that want to manage memberships such as political parties and schools.

## Components

We will be working on 3 main components that make up the membership app mainly:

- Backend
- Admin Portal
- Self Service App

### Backend

All the models, services and core business functionality that the admin portal and self service apps are built on top of can be found in this project.
