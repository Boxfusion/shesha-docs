## Overview

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.

## Getting Started

In this tutorial we will introduce you to Storybook and how to get productive and working within it. 

This guide requires you to have completed the [Shesha React JS Guide](https://shesha-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/02-Shesha-ReactJS/) so that you have storybook ready to work with.

## Creating Pages for Components

### Storybook Introduction Page

Each component you create on storybook needs to have an introduction page, we use this page to describe what the component is and how we use the component.
