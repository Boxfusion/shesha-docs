Once this step is complete we can now run the app using the following CLI

``` shell
npm run dev
```

This will then build and serve the application on the following URL

``` shell
http://localhost:3050
```

You can manually navigate there or (ctrl + click) on the URL when it appears in your IDE teerminal. This will launch the following screen.
