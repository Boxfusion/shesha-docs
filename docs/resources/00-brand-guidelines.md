# Brand Guidelines

## Logos, Icons and Colours

The Shesha logo is our universal logo for all Shesha based applications. We want it to be instantly recognizable, so consistency is important — please don’t edit, change, distort, recolor, or reconfigure it.

Below you’ll find downloadable versions of the logos and Icons:

#### Horizontal Logo's

### Shesha Logo

The preferred approach is to use the Horizontal Shesha logo, locked with the wordmark. This allows flexibility to present the logo with greater prominence while maintaining a considered, open and modern presentation.

## Clear Space

Clear space buffers the logo from images, text, or other graphics that compromise its impact and visibility. The more breathing room you give our logo, the greater the impact it can have.

## Sizing

We’ve optimized our logo for specific sizes. The Shesha Logo and Wordmark must be crystal clear and legible, whether it appears on a smartphone or the jumbo screen in an arena.

## Full Logo with Wordmark

The full-color logos pair our Shesha icon with a full Black (#000000) or White (#FFFFFF) text.

The Black full-color logo can be shown on a white background or light imagery.

The White full-color logo can be shown on a black background or dark imagery.

## Shesha Icon

The Shesha Logo Icon is a flexible mark that can act as a call to action or a shorter version of the full Shesha Logo. If you don't have room to use the full logo at minimum size with the required clear space, you should use the Shesha Icon without the wordmark instead.
