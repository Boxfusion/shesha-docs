# Brand Guidelines

## Logos, Icons and Colours

The Shesha logo is our universal logo for all Shesha based applications. We want it to be instantly recognizable, so consistency is important — please don’t edit, change, distort, recolor, or reconfigure it.

Below you’ll find downloadable versions of the logo:

### Shesha Horizontal Logo with Wordmark

The preferred approach is to use the Horizontal Shesha logo, locked with the wordmark. This allows flexibility to present the logo with greater prominence while maintaining a considered, open and modern presentation.
